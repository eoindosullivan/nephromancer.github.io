# Parathyroidectomy in CKD

RIE Protocol

## Pre Operative Care
* Alfacalcidol 2mcg bd should be given for 3 days prior to surgery.
* Cinacalcet should be stopped one week before parathyroidectomy.
* Patients at risk of hungry bone syndrome should be identified.

## Hungry Bone Syndrome
Diagnosis hinges on a profound and persistently low calcium level of less than 2.1 mmol/L
for more than four days postoperatively along with hypophosphatemia and normal PTH
levels. Such patients require prolonged, high dose calcium to maintain serum calcium levels.
Often there is also associated hypomagnesemia and hypocalciuria. Risk factors include

* Alkaline phosphatase > 2 times upper limit of normal
* PTH levels> 100 pmol/L
* Radiologic evidence of bone disease
* Higher BMI
* Higher BUN

## Post Operative Care
* Patients should be admitted to ward 215 post operatively and prescribed Alfacalcidol 2mcg bd & Calvive (formally Sandocal1000) 2 tablets tds - Do not take at mealtimes.
* Hold phosphate binders.
* Serum corrected calcium should be measured every 6 hours for the first 24 hours post surgery, and then less frequently if stable.
* Aim for normal serum calcium values (2.2-2.6 mmol/L). Increase calcium supplementation by 50% if calcium falling and half the dose if calcium starts to rise.
* Pay attention to the trend. If the corrected calcium is falling rapidly i.e. >10% over 6 hrs the
development of significant hypocalcaemia is likely and requires more frequent monitoring.
* If calcium <1.8 or if symptomatic, give IV calcium 
* Monitor serum phosphate and magnesium 12 hourly for first 24hrs, then daily.
* Do not treat hypophosphataemia unless serum phosphate falls below 0.35 mmol/l.
* Consider higher calcium dialysate (A232, A231 containing calcium 1.5 mmol) or PD fluid.

## Post Discharge
RRT patients: Monitor serum calcium on each HD session or 3 times a week (for PD
patients) for the first two weeks and weekly checks as required thereafter until stability is
reached.

The dosing of alfacalcidol and calcium supplements post operatively is challenging and both
hypo- and hypercalcaemia are common. Trends in concentration are more important than
absolute values. Consider the following:

* Check adherence and adjust calcium supplement by +- 50%.
* Alfacalcidol dose to increase up to a maximum of 5 micrograms bd but note it takes 3
days to observe effect of increase in dose. Alfacalcidol product specification
recommends increasing dose in increments of 0.25 â€“ 0.5 micrograms but if taking 2
micrograms or more change dose by 1 microgram.
* Check magnesium levels and replace if recurrent /resistant hypocalcaemia

# IV Calcium Infusion
Use calcium gluconate over calcium chloride. Care must be taken to ensure intravenous
calcium is not extravasated. If central line is available this is likely to be most suitable
access. If venous access is not secure, then a central line may be considered.

**Infusion**

* 100ml of 10% calcium gluconate (900mg of elemental calcium) +150 ml of 5% Dextrose
(total volume 250 ml). Final concentration is 3.6mg/ml.
* Start infusion at 0.3ml/kg/hour (1mg/kg/hour. 70kg patient = 21ml/hr)
* Check corrected serum calcium 6 hourly.
* Titrate calcium infusion dose between 0-0.6ml/kg/hour to prevent serum calcium
falling below 1.9mmol/L or rising above 2.4 mmol/L.
* Severe symptoms include paraesthesia, muscle cramps, carpo-pedal spasm, laryngeal
stridor, convulsions, prolonged QT interval, arrhythmias, and hypotension. This will require
bolus IV calcium and subsequent infusion.

### Emergency Calcium Bolus
Emergency situations - Give 10ml of 10% calcium gluconate (2.2mmol calcium) no faster
than 2ml/min (i.e., Over at least 5mins, ECG monitoring recommended); this can be given
peripherally.

### IGAN

* Hyponatraemia is all about ADH typically
* Isothenuria normal in aging and in AKI/CKD.
  + Urine diulation is active and difficult 
  + Normal adult can generate dilute urine - 50mOSM/Kg
  + "Normal" diet is 10mOSM/kg/day, so 70kg male = (10*70)=700/50(daily limit)=14litres
  + Elderly limit ~150 mOSM/kg. Diet intake can be low (tea and toast) e.g. (3*50)/150=1Litre/day. free water over this limit dilutes urine.
  
* **Hypotonic** hyponatraemia requires treatment (probably), so confirm a pOSM if possible.
* k+ is oncotic too ( and can buffer NA) - 20mmol/KCL = 40ml 3% NaCL - may overcorrect if not aware!

Steroids in IgAN

* Patients with IGAN 1g proteinuria, 12 week run in ACEi/ARB randomised to methylpred ( high,low) /placebo. N=503, 5 countries, mean age 38.
* Excluded: Secondary IGAN, MCD, >50% crescents, infection, cancer
* Outcome: 40% decreased in eGFR/ESKD/death
* Methylpred  high (HR 0.58), low (HR 0.27) significantly reduced primary outcome, many serious AE but  in low dose ~ placebo
*Low dose Regime: (0.4 mg/kg/day, maximum 32 mg/day) for 2 months, followed by weaning by 4 mg/day/month over 6-9 months, or matching placebo. PJP prophylaxis for 12 weeks.
* **Conclusion:** Probably useful but potentially a high price to pay â€“ save for rapid decliner ?

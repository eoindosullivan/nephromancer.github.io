<center> **Notes for the busy Nephrologist** </center>
<br>
Here you will find a growing collection of nephrology related notes for educational purposes. Topics are developed on a semi-random basis as I encounter them on the wards, or on request. Some pages are placeholders.

Please note that official KHS resources such as procedures, policies and forms are located on the [**intranet**](http://www.rbwhrenal.com)

A mismash of ideas and notes:

COL4a5
### Is the familial deafness of a sensory- neural form.? Any  corneal or retinal   abnormalities.  The absence  of hematuria cannot be used to exclude X-linked Alport Syndrome in a heterozygous  female (see Rheault M Pediatric Nephrology 2012; 27:41-46)  Genetic studies are indicated., with a request for rapid turnaround.  A careful exam of cornea and retina is also needed. A skin biopsy with staining for alpha 5 chains of COL4 might be useful,   But tissue   Mosiacism  due to Lyonization of one  C-chromosome will make interpretation difficult

## HEP C Donor kidney

Recipients of kidney transplants from HCV-RNA–positive deceased donors had 5-year mean allograft survival that was not statistically different from HCV-RNA–negative kidney recipients during the direct-acting antiviral era [JAMA 2022](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2795744)

#### Interesting misc notes

-   Certain elements of cognitive function may [improve post Tx](https://www.ajkd.org/article/S0272-6386(24)00624-3/fulltext)

-   BMI is always a contentious topic. Higher BMI can lead to increased DGF but in retrospective data [>35BMI = 30-35BMI in longer term outcomes.](https://www.ajkd.org/article/S0272-6386(21)00534-5/abstract). Clearly some selection bias baked in there, but worthy of reflection. 

-   When converting from oral to IV tacrolimus the following conversion must be done:
IV tacrolimus dose = total daily oral dose x 0.25
To be given as a continuous infusion over 24 hours
Therapeutic drug monitoring is essential when undertaking any conversion with tacrolimus. aiming 10-15. IV ciclosporin is an alternative option. Bump steroids to cover.

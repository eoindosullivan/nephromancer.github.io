## VTE prophylaxis in Nephrotic syndrome

-   Variable incidence, depending on population being studied 3-36%(!)
-   Can be any vascular bed, venous or arterial and include cerebral vein/arteries, coronaries.

**Pathophysiology**

-   Loss of fibrinolytic factors such as antithrombin III, plasminogen, protein S, plasmin.
-   Simultaneously, the liver upregulates thromboxane A1, VwF and Cholesterol, fibrinogen, Factor V, VIII
-   Hypovolaemia may be a factor
-   Heparin resistance due to urinary antithrombin loss?

**VTE timeline**

-   Membranous Nephropathy (MN) has highest risk: HR of 10 vs non nephrotic control, about 8% overall incidence.
-   MN has VTE sooner: Typically, about 150 days to first VTE vs 300 in other GN.
-   MN: Median time to VTE 3.8 month (IQR 0-1 â€“ 12.1)
-   4/56 clots discovered at time of first presentation with proteinuria
-   Albumin: each 10g/L drop in alb increases HR by \~2
-   Albumin of 28 is a reasonable cut off with a HR of 2.53 for VTE above and below

**Drug choice**

-   Warfarin first line
-   LMWH second line, dosing slightly unclear, a level may be most appropriate.
-   Multiple cautionary case reports of DOACs failing individual patients in NS, although they *probably* work for most people, [highly variable kinetics](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9546608/). Avoid if possible.

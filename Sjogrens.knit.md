# Sjogrens



All comers..

[Indian Cohort of 174](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30155666/)

-   **Renal Involvement**: 50% invovlment ( screened 174)
-   **Tubular  Lesions**: 29/174 had RTA. Younger. Periodic paralysis.
-   **Bx**: few bx - , TIN 9/17, IGA 3/17. 


[French Cohort of 95 Biopsy proven Renal involvment](https://hal.science/hal-01791205)

-   **Renal Involvement**: 97.9% had tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN), with plasma cell infiltrates in 75%.
-   **Glomerular Lesions**: Found in 23.2% of patients, often associated with cryoglobulinemia.
-   **Prognosis**: Anti-SSA/SSB antibodies were linked to worse outcomes.
-   **Treatment**: Corticosteroids improved kidney function, though no added benefit was seen with immunosuppressive agents like rituximab.
-   **Outcome**: Despite fibrosis, significant improvement in eGFR was observed

[Mayo](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19679669/) biopsed 24/7276 patients over 24 years. 71% TIN, 2 cryos, 2 FSGS. 83% pred, 17 ritux. Generally improved and didnt progress regardless of Rx.

### RTA

[Chinese Cohort of 257 pSS RTA](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36383239/)

-   **Age** pSS patients with RTA had younger disease onset  (40 vs 46)
-   **Higher EULAR Sjogrens Disease activity index** disease activity
-   **eGFR** lower, 25% CKD vs 6% compared to those without renal involvement. 
-   Independent risk factors for RTA included early disease onset ( <35 years, OR 3), thyroid disorders (OR 1.4), arthritis(OR 1.5), anti-SSB antibodies(OR 1.8), and elevated inflammatory markers, alk phos, low alb, anaemnia (OR ~1.5)

## Treatment

Steroids for TIN, [CTX is an option](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29241210/), particularly higher risk, high IgG levels

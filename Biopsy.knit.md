# CARI bx guidelines 2019

## Pre bx

-   Risk for bleeding hb \<80 but not recommended to transfuse
-   Control BP \<140 sys, no evidence (not in CARI, just my own feeling)
-   Ensure plts \<50 and INR \<1.5

## Drugs

-   Continue **Aspirin** if high risk
    -   Within 3 months of bare metal or 12 months of drug eluting stent
    -   Symptomatic myocardial ischemia
    -   PVD (including PV stent)
    -   Previous ischaemic stroke
-   Stop **Aspirin** if low risk for 3 days to prevent major bleeding, 7 to prevent minor
-   Stop ADP (**clopidogrel / prasugrel**) 5-7 days prior
-   **Warfarin** 5 days
-   DOAC (**dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban**) 48-72 hours pre
-   **Heparin** 4-6 hours
-   **LMWH** 24 hours

CARI suggest bridging in high VTE risk

-   Mechanical mitral valve
-   Mechanical aortic + additional risk factors
-   APS
-   Embolic event in last 3 months
-   AF with CHADS2VASC 5 or 6 + previous thromboembolic event

Wait **24-48** hours before restarting anything

## Desmopressin

-   0.3ug/kg IV 30 mins pre bx. No evidence either way.
-   If it has any role it would be in advanced CKD, uraemic patients.
-   If given, avoid excessive fluids obviously ( 6-8 hours)
-   Hypothetical risk of thrombosis = avoid in severe CV disease/vascular stent

## Proceedure

-   16 G needle, consider throw distance if possible
-   USS always, CT if tricky
-   Super aneterolateral position for obese / resp difficulty
-   Prone with pillow under abdo to splint kidneys for natives
-   Supine for tx

## Post bx

-   6-24 hours observation
-   Low risk patients 6-8 hours and same day discharge
-   Admit the higher risks for 24 hrs
    -   Advanced CKD
    -   AKI
    -   HTN
    -   \>70 years old
    -   Anticoagulation issues

Regular obs, check urine frequently

No heavy physical activity for 1-2 weeks

## Bleeding

-   IV fluid resuscitation
-   CT angio
-   If prolonged urinary tract bleeding or post bx HTN screen for AVF (CT or US) â€“ interventional radiology for initial management
-   Surgical team if radiologically failing

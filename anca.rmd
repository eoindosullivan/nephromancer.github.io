ANCA & GBM tends to be necrotising crescents on a background of a normal glom - if there is underyling abnormal/path in the glom, consider non-ANCA disease

# TIPS

### Post remission rising in ANCA

Per Stegeman on the ASN forums:

-   In general a significant rise in ANCA titer, either PR3 or MPO, over a period of 3-6 months is associated with a risk of relapse of around 60% in the 6-12 months following the ANCA rise. 
-   The other 40% will not have a relapse of disease over a period of 1-2  years. 
-   What a significant rise in ANCA is, is totally dependent on the test used (indirect immune fluorescent tests usually at least a fourfold rise (2 titer steps); ELISA based methods 75-100% increase and 2-3 times the upper limit of normal (so changes in the very low positive range usually mean not much) and should be analyzed for the test you are using to quantify ANCA levels. 
-   In our experience a continuous slow rise in ANCA (so less than a significant rise in 3-6 months or over a longer period) does not have much prognostic value above the baseline risk of ~10-20% annual risk of relapse associated with persistent positive PR3-ANCA in the first 5 years after diagnosis and initial treatment (for MPO-ANCA the risk seems lower probably more around 5-10%)

So I would advise not to treat an isoloated (significant!) rise in ANCA titer unless you want to minimize the risk of relapse to the absolute minimum (because you fear the consequences of the relapse for the patient, which seems not be the case for this particular patient (given the bothersome but not lifethreatening manifestations of her disease and the fact that most relapses copy the initial presentation and it is unusual (unfortunately not impossible) to have more extensive/severe disease manifestations during relapse as compared to the previous presentations).

## Iron

* Screen annually in CKD G3, biannually in CKD G4
* Investigate  - EPO def is dx of exclusion. "possible"" in eGFR <60, "probable" in <30

#### Iron studies

  + % HRC if able to process within 6 hours 
  + Reticulocyte Hb count (CHr)
  + TSATS and ferritin ( if above not available or thalassaemia)
  + Ferritin & CRP
  + PTH & TFT ( can contribute to iron def)
  + Consider - b12/folate/haemolysis/plasma&urine electrophroesis, hb electrophoresis, LTC & Marrow
  + Scopes etc
  
#### Iron repletion

* %HRC <6% / CHr >29 pg / ferritin and TSAT (>100 microgram/L and >20%). 
* Oral iron usually ok for CKD, PD. IV for HD.
* If not in centre, high dose low frequency is good


### Iron Therapy 

* In HD proactive high-dose IV iron sucrose (venofer) 400 mg every month (or equivalent) should be given unless ferritin > 700 μg/L or TSAT>40% ( PIVITOL)
* Avoid in infection, probably
* Monitor quarterly
* Hb Targets: 100-120
* Caution in malignancy

* **Limits** Feritin =< 800. Review iron therapy when hits 500. 

In Edinburgh use iron as ferric derisomaltose (Diafer) ~100mg weekly/monthly etc during HD. This is low dose :(

* High dose IV iron vs low dose
* High dose non inferior for compositive CV | death endpoint
* Less CV composite events in high dose hazard ratio, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.64 to 1.00
* Less Blood transfusions
* Same infections

### ESA

* Caution htn - 175/95 as arbitrary cut offs
* Neorecoromon is 150 units/kg body weight/week. This is usually administered as 3 divided doses (but can be given as a single weekly dose), given intravenously during haemodialysis. 70kg man gets 3500 units each session (10,500/3)
* Adjust in 25-50% increments


### Resistance to ESA therapy

Failure to reach the target
Hb level despite SC epoetin dose >300 IU/kg/week (450 IU/kg/week IV epoetin), or darbepoetin dose >1.5
microgram/kg/week. ( 70kg man = 7000 units/session)

Hyporesponsive patients who are iron replete should be screened clinically and by
investigations for other common causes of anaemia.

### Pure Red Cell Aplasia

Considered whenever a patient receiving
long term ESA therapy (more than 8 weeks) develops all the following (2A):

* sudden decrease in Hb concentration at the rate of 5 to 10g/L per week OR requirement of
transfusions at the rate of approximately 1 to 2 per week
*  normal platelet and white cell counts,
* absolute reticulocyte count less than 10,000/µl

ESA therapy should be stopped in patients who develop ESA induced PRCA.

Patients who remain transfusion dependent after withdrawing ESA therapy should be
treated with immunosuppressant medications guided by the level of anti EPO antibodies

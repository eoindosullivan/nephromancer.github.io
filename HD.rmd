# Vaccinations

**HEP B – 1/3 don’t respond. At 1 year, only about \~64% have adequate Ab protection**

-   **HBVAXPRO** 40 micrograms at 0, 1 and 6 months by IM injection. Not in buttocks – go deltoid – better response.
-   **Fendrix** -20micrograms at 0,1,2 and 6 months
-   **Engerix** B -40 micrograms at 0,1,2 and 6 months

Check anti-Hbs antibodies 1-2 months after course.

-   **Responder**: \>100mIU/ml .
-   **Partial response**: 10-100mIU/ml. Give booster (once) and recheck in 1-2 months.
-   **Non response**: \<10mIU/ml. Repeat entire course once only. If still \<10mIU/ml, then patient is a ‘non responder’ and move on. If level 10-100mIU/ml then treat as partial response.
    -   If non response, check for ABsag and either proceed as acute infection if + or “vulnerable”
    -   HBIG postexposure prophylaxis for any known or likely parenteral exposure to HBsAg positive blood is available.
-   Once established, annual check with a booster if \<100mIu/ml.

**Notes:**

-   Better immune response and high rates of conversion if given before ESKD
-   If started on normal dose pre HD but transitioning to HD during vaccine course, increase to the double dose (40mg) once on HD
-   Ab tires \>10 are still protective


**Other Vaccines**

-   Annual inactivated influenza
-   Pneumococcal: Regime varies depending on history and PCV13/PPSV23: See table 2 and table 3 of the appendix of CDC document [here](https://www.cdc.gov/dialysis/pdfs/vaccinating_dialysis_patients_and_patients_dec2012.pdf) 
-   [Green book](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/immunisation-against-infectious-disease-the-green-book#the-green-book)
-   COVID probably

# Dry weight

-   BP should be normal throughout, high post HD BP ?wet
-   Can take \~3 months to get to a first dry weight – persistence is key
-   Early tapering of BP meds can help hit dry weight (evidence?)
-   Hypotension/cramps = refill capacity. Does not necessarily mean at dry weight
-   BP normalisation can lag weeks after ECF volume normalisation (?evidence)

# Adequacy

**URR:** ((Pre urea-post urea)\*100)/Pre-urea

-   Underestimates due to ignoring urea clearance during UF and intra HD urea generation
-   Target 70%. Mostly a Fn of Qb and Time

**Single Pool Kt/V**

-   Accounts of size by using TBW in formula

-   Urea Clearance(K)\*Time(T)/Vd of Urea (55% TBW in men, 50% in women)

-   Target 1.4, min 1.2

**Equilibrated Kt/V**

-   Optimal

-   Wait 30 mins for equilibration before second sample

## HEMO study

<div class = "blue">
[HEMO](<https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa021583>)

-   1846 patients 3\*week HD

-   Primary outcome: death

-   Secondary outcome: hospitalization for cardiac causes or death from any cause, first hospitalization for infection or death from any cause, first 15 percent decrease in the serum albumin level or death from any cause, and all hospitalizations not related to vascular access

-   Results: No difference between high dose (Kt/v 1.7, URR 75) vs low (Kt/V 1.16, URR 66). No difference between high flux and low flux.

# HD Prescription tips

-   Lower temps = greater tolerability and possibly CV/Neuro outcomes
-   Qb 300-500, Qd 500-800
-   Initiation: 2hr Qb200 Qd500 ,3hr Qb250 Qd500 ,4hrs Qb300 Qd800.
-   Never use a 0 K+ bath (if its even an option) – too much K flux
-   Post Tx: avoid hypotension (assoc. with increase risk of acute rejection)
-   Acidaemic: Check ionised Calcium – the incoming bicarb load will drop the iCa - \>seizures etc

# Severe Uraemia

-   Pericarditis is a clinical diagnosis
-   **Rx:*** Daily HD, no anticoagulation
-   Check for pericardial effusion 
-   Chest pain – improves leaning forward, friction rub, distant heart sounds. Fever/sob. BP low. Tachycardic.
-   **ECG:** Diffuse ST & T wave elevation – not typically coronary territory. electrical alternans = pericardiocentesis. Trop leak.
-   **JVP:** Kussmaul's sign is a paradoxical rise in jugular venous pressure (JVP) on inspiration
-   **Pulsus paradoxus: aka exaggerated respiratory variation**
-   Inflate 30mmHg above pulse. Note first intermittent Korotkoff sounds. (higher systemic BP occurring during expiration). Slowly deflate cuff until highest BP with continuous beat. The delta is the pulsus paradoxus. \>10mmHg suggest tamponade.
 -   **CXR:** Increased cardiac silhouette
-   **ECHO:** Effusion in 50% of uraemic pericarditis. Repeat echo to ensure resolution 3-5 days.
-   **D.Dx:** Infectious/inflammation(SLE/vasculitis), neoplastic, meds(hydralazine)

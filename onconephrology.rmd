# Immune checkpoint inhibitors

nice [review](https://doi.org/10.1093/ndt/gfae184) in NDT, broader multiorgan [guidelines](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6481621/)

**Incidence:** 

-   ICI-AKI affects 2%â€“5% of patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors.  
-   Median time 12-16 weeks post initiation (regardless of AIN or GN). 
-   20% of cases are late onset ( post 3 weeks since last dose), 11%  more than a year after initiation, can be early.

**Diagnosis** 

-   Kidney biopsy is the most accurate diagnostic method due to non-specific clinical or biochemical markers. sterile pyruia(45%?) and sub nephrotic range protein - 29% had none. IRL you can usually just start steroids if clinical diagnosis can be made. Distal RTA can happen, persists post steroids. 
-    Potentially helpful: CRP, hx of prior/past irAE.

**Histopathology**

-   Acute tubulointerstitial nephritis (ATIN) is the most common finding in ICI-AKI cases - 90%. 

-   Of the Rare GN :Glom lesions or vasculitis possible  - typically ANCA neg(27%), podocytopathys (24%) and c3GN (11%), and 41% have concomitant AIN according to [KI Reports](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468024920316405). 35% complete and 38% patrial remission of proteinuria., 25% needed RRT.


**Risk Factors** 

-   Concurrent use of ATIN-associated drugs (e.g., proton pump inhibitors) increases the risk; avoiding these drugs during ICI therapy is recommended.Prior extra renal IRAE in 50-100%. Dual ICI blokade (CTLA-4 & PD1/PDL1) = [OR1.3](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34625513/)

**Renal Recovery** 

- Most patients achieve full or partial renal recovery.

**Rx** 

-   Early corticosteroid initiation (within 3 days) significantly improves recovery chances. 1mg/kg to nearest 60mg. can pulse 250 if severe AKI3. Taper - 10/week to 20. then 5/week to 0.(don't forget PJP prophylaxis.)
-   Steroid-Sparing Options: MMF, infliximab, rituximab.
-   pembro has a half life of 27.3 days, so longer taper may help 
-   Relapse rate of ~10% post Pred withdrawal. [No difference in relapse ( AKI or death composite) rates between longer vs shorter steroid regimes](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9511654/). Recurrence occurs earlie, within the month typically. Median 20 days in short steroid course and 5 in long.


**ICI Re-challenge**

-   Re-challenge is generally well tolerated, with ~20% experiencing recurrent ICI-AKI. Severity of AKI doesnt predict relapse. prophylactic pred probably doesn't help. 6-10 weeks to recurrence, shorter latency time. do 2 weekly labs. Vast majority of patients will respond to steroids during a recurrence. A rechallenge can lead to other, non renal events e.g. myocarditis, hepatitis etc.

**Notes**

-   [27- 50%](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29684232/) of patient can have reactivation of autoimmune disease
-   [Reactivation of MN](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33020246/)
-   Tx - almost universal rejection with the PD-1 inhibitor, anti CLTLA-4 may have [less risk](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468024920316405)
-   Can cause adrenal and central ahypoadrenalism - watch out for hyponatraemia etc

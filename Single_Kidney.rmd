## Single Kidney

Aim is to avoid hyperfiltration, secondary FSGS.

Heamodynamic and structural changes occur in a single kidney: Glom hypertrophy and hyperfiltration lead to podocyte injury and proteinuria. Each cause is approached differently.

**Acquired: Surgical**

(Donor, trauma, nephrectomy etc)

-   Aggressive CKD risk factor management
-   avoidance of excessively high [dietary protein](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/protein-intake) intake (\>1 g/kg per day)
-   avoid high [dietary sodium](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/sodium-intake) intake (\>4 grams/d)
-   Keep BMI \<30
-   Cystatin C & Cr formula likely best
-   Follow up unclear, needs to be bespoke: 6-12 months, discharge if stable.

[Outcomes post nephrectomy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0302283812004034) for RCC: n= 4633, Partial nephrectomy = 11% CKD, 2% ESKD, radical = 20% CKD 4% ESKD.

Nice review of surgical outcomes [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468024919314019)

The current best review I have found is in [CJASN](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4011451/)

**Acquired: Non Surgical**

RAS, obstructive (stones/valve/infection) – consider appropriate imaging if suspicious. No guidelines, best to have low index of suspicion in an adult for RAS as while you may not intervene it places them at an extremely high vascular risk needing aggressive risk factor control.

**Congenital**

Check for over ipsilateral CAKUT on imaging

-   Kidney: horse-shoe, hypoplastic, duplex, single, multicystic dysplastic
-   Collecting system anomalies: PUJ, VUJ
-   Bladder: prune belly, VU reflux
-   Ureteral: posterior valves

Features of overt CAKUT require surgical correction (in paeds) and closer follow up as higher risk – [ideally annually](https://academic.oup.com/ndt/article/26/5/1458/1894859)

Renal agenesis (URA) isnt the same as multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK), [outcomes are worse](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00467-021-05064-1) with URA.

“URA had a higher prevalence of comorbid genetic syndromes (15 vs. 6%, *p*=0.04), non-renal anomalies (39 vs. 11%, *p*\<0.001), and congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) (51 vs. 26%, *p*\<0.001) than MCDK. Over follow-up, URA experienced more hypertension (19 vs. 3%, *p*=0.002), proteinuria (12 vs. 3%, *p*=0.03), and the composite outcome (19 vs. 6%, *p*=0.003) than MCDK. Independent risk factors for chronic kidney injury included CAKUT (OR 5.01, *p*=0.002) and URA (OR 2.71, *p*=0.04).”

Hypoplastic kidney [presentations](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8790306/)

-   age of 39.5 ± 11.2 (19-73) years.
-   Loin pain(51.5%)
-   Stone passed (9.1%)
-   Anuria (12.1%)
-   Incidental discovery (15.2%)
-   UTI (12.1%).

Urolithiasis occurred in 23 (69.7%) cases and pyuria was detected in 22 (66.7%) cases where the infection was documented by culture and sensitivity test in 19 cases. While the non-complicated cases were managed by assurance only (12.1%), nephrectomy (15.2%) was performed for persistent complications. However, symptomatic (27.3%) and endoscopic (45.6%) approaches were used for the management of correctable complications.

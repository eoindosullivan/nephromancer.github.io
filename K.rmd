# HypoKalaemia

Easy

# HypoKalaemia

## HypoK & Alkalosis 

## Hyperaldo and pseudohyperaldosteronism.

Aldosterone controls K & H secretion and NA reabsorbtion via the ENAC channel on the cortical collecting duct epithelial cells

Therefore , hyper/pseudo hyper looks like *the opposite of taking Spironolactone*

i.e. HypoK & Alkalosis **& HTN**

Obvious overlap here with the monogenic causes of [HTN](www.nephromancer.com/htn) - info on both pages

## Adrenal hyperfunction / primary hyperaldosteronism

-   including adrenal adenoma, adrenal hyperplasia, and adrenal carcinoma.


## Syndrome of apparent mineralocorticoid excess



## Liddles

Autosomal dominant Gain of function of ENAC



## Licorice ingestion = Syndrome of Apparent Mineralocorticoid Excess

[six tea bags of ‘Twinings Comforting’ liquorice tea dail](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5298563/)

European licorice is worse than american stuff, more GZA

-   Remember, Aldosterone controls K & H secretion and NA reabsorbtion via the ENAC channel on the cortical collecting duct epithelial cells
-   Cortisol can also activate this but is converted to inactive cortisone by enzyme 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2. phew
-   Unless licorice inactivates the enzyme first!
-   The compound in licorice that is responsible for this enzyme inhibitory activity is glycyrrhetinic acid, which also has some mild mineralocorticoid activity. 
-   This is the same as syndrome of apparant mineralocorticoid excess = mutations in the 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzyme that prevent proper conversion of cortisol into cortisone.
-   The European Union’s scientific committee on food recommends a daily upper limit of 100 mg for glycyrrhizin6 which is present in approximately 50g liquorice (assuming a content of 0.2% glycyrrhizin)
-   11β-HSD2 can remain suppressed for 2 weeks or so after withdrawal of licorice, but the RAS axis can remain suppressed for months , perhaps 4
-  inhibition of 11β-HSD2 decreases the urinary ratio of cortisone metabolites to cortisol metabolites which is a diagnostic clue for this mechanism of secondary hypertension

## Renal artery stenosis and renin secreting tumors. 

-   elevated production and secretion of renin leading to hyperaldosteronism.


## Renin:Aldosterone ratio

Liddle’s — low renin, low aldo (appropriate suppression in face of gained function)
Licorice and SAME — low renin, low aldo ( body is responding appropriatly and shutting down in face of feedback)
Renal artery stenosis and renin-secreting tumors — high renin, high aldo ( kidneys think blood flow is low)
Adrenal hyperfunction — low renin, high aldo (appropriately suppressed renin)


## Cushings and ectopic ACTH
